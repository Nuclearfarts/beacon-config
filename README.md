# beacon-config
fabric mod to make beacons more configurable

Configuration is datapack-based. Configuration goes in `data/beaconconfig/config/beaconconfig.json`. THE ROOT FOR THIS PATH IS NOT THE WORLD FOLDER. It's the datapack folder. Read the MC wiki article https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack. Look at the base file at https://github.com/Nuclearfarts/beacon-config/blob/master/src/main/resources/data/beaconconfig/config/beaconconfig.json, I don't feel like actually writing a tutorial for this.
